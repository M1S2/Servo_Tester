## PCB
The schematic and PCB are created using Fusion 360. It is designed to be manufactured using toner transfer method so all traces are as big as possible. This is only a one-sided PCB.

## Mechanic
There is no special housing for this servo tester.

The only mechanical parts are:
- USB_Plastic_Plate: a thin plastic plate to ensure the correct thickness of the USB-plug part. The complete thickness including the PCB, solder and the plastic plate should be approx. 2 mm.
- Potentiometer_Knob: a knob for easier operation of the potentiometer. This isn't necessary. The default potentiometer axis can also be used.
